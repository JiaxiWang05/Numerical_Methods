## Code Overview

### Main Script

```matlab
% Number of subdivisions for the finite difference method
n = 60;

% Computation of the solution for the bridge problem
[x, u_bridge] = fdode_bridge(0, 60, n, @f_bridge, 0, 0, 10^3);

% Plot the solution
plot(x, u_bridge, '-o')
```

### Explanation:
1. **`n = 60`**: The interval `[0, 60]` is divided into 60 subintervals for the finite difference method.
2. **`fdode_bridge`**: Solves the differential equation using finite differences.
   - `a = 0, b = 60`: The domain of the cable.
   - Boundary conditions: `u(0) = 0, u(60) = 0`.
   - Coefficient (`coef = 10^3`): Defines the cable's stiffness.
3. **Plot**: Visualizes the deflection curve.

---

### Force Function: `f_bridge`

```matlab
function f = f_bridge(x)
```

#### Description
Defines the external forces acting on the cable. The bridge's deck applies a downward force of 100 N at discrete points every 10 meters.

#### Implementation
```matlab
f = zeros(length(x), 1); % Initialize force vector

for i = 1:length(x)
   if mod(x(i), 10) == 0 % Apply force at every 10 meters
       f(i) = 100;
   else
       f(i) = 0; % No force otherwise
   end
end
```

#### Key Points:
- **Force Calculation**:
  - At positions `x` that are multiples of 10, `f(x) = 100` N.
  - Elsewhere, `f(x) = 0`.
- **Output**: A vector `f`, representing forces at each node.

### Finite Difference Solver: `fdode_bridge`

```matlab
function [x, u] = fdode_bridge(a, b, n, f, alpha, beta, coef)
```

#### Description

```

using the finite difference method.

#### Inputs:

   h = (b - a) / n; % Compute step size
   x = (a:h:b)';    % Generate nodes
   ```

2. **Matrix Setup**:

   F(1) = F(1) + alpha;         % Apply left boundary condition
   F(n-1) = F(n-1) + beta;      % Apply right boundary condition
   ```

4. **Solve System**:
   ```matlab
   u = zeros(n+1, 1); % Initialize solution
   u(2:n) = A \ F;    % Solve for interior nodes
   ```

5. **Boundary Conditions**:
   ```matlab
   u(1) = alpha;       % Apply left BC
   u(n+1) = beta;      % Apply right BC
   ```

---

### Numerical Method

#### Finite Difference Approximation:
The differential equation:

```
- coef * u''(x) = f(x)
```

is approximated using:

```
- coef * (u_{i-1} - 2u_i + u_{i+1}) / h^2 = f(x_i).
```

Rewriting:

```
u_{i-1} - 2u_i + u_{i+1} = - (h^2 / coef) * f(x_i).
```

This forms a linear system that is solved using matrix methods.

```
- **`n`**: Specifies the number of subintervals for the finite difference method. The higher the number, the finer the resolution of the solution.

---

### **2. Compute the Cable's Deflection**

3. **`@f_bridge`**:
   - The function `f_bridge` defines the external force acting on the cable at specified positions.
4. **`alpha = 0, beta = 0`**:
   - Boundary conditions: The deflection of the cable at both ends (\( x = 0 \) and \( x = 60 \)) is zero.
5. **`coef = 10^3`**:
   - Stiffness coefficient of the material.

---

- **`'-o'`**: Plot style indicating the solution is visualized with points connected by lines.

---

## **Core Functions**

### **1. Force Function: `f_bridge`**

```matlab
function f = f_bridge(x)
```
#### Purpose:
- Compute the forces acting on the cable. The bridge's deck is attached to the cable every 10 meters, with a downward force of 100 N at each attachment point.

#### Implementation:
```matlab
f = zeros(length(x), 1); % Initialize the force vector
for i = 1:length(x)
   if mod(x(i), 10) == 0 % Check if the position is a multiple of 10
       f(i) = 100; % Apply a downward force of 100 N
   else
       f(i) = 0; % No force otherwise
   end
end
```

#### Explanation:
- **`mod(x(i), 10)`** checks whether the position \( x(i) \) is a multiple of 10 (bridge attachment points).
- Forces are applied only at these points.

---

### **2. Finite Difference Solver: `fdode_bridge`**

```matlab
function [x, u] = fdode_bridge(a, b, n, f, alpha, beta, coef)
```
#### Purpose:
- Solve the elliptic second-order ODE:
  \[
  - \text{coef} \cdot u''(x) = f(x) \quad \text{for } x \in [a, b]
  \]
  with boundary conditions:
  \[
  u(a) = \alpha, \quad u(b) = \beta
  \]

#### Implementation:

1. **Step Size**:
   ```matlab
   h = (b - a) / n;
   x = (a:h:b)';
   ```
   - Divide the interval \([a, b]\) into \( n \) subintervals of size \( h \).

2. **Matrix Assembly**:
   ```matlab
   A = gallery('tridiag', n - 1, 1, -2, 1);
   ```
   - Create a tridiagonal matrix representing the finite difference approximation of \( u''(x) \).

3. **Right-Hand Side Vector**:
   ```matlab
   F = h^2 .* f(x(2:n)) / coef;
   F(1) = F(1) + alpha; % Apply left boundary condition
   F(n - 1) = F(n - 1) + beta; % Apply right boundary condition
   ```

4. **Solve Linear System**:
   ```matlab
   u = zeros(n + 1, 1); % Initialize solution
   u(2:n) = A \ F; % Solve for interior nodes
   ```

5. **Boundary Conditions**:
   ```matlab
   u(1) = alpha; % Apply left boundary condition
   u(n + 1) = beta; % Apply right boundary condition
   ```

---

### **Finite Difference Method in Depth**

#### Discretization:
The second-order differential equation:
\[
- \text{coef} \cdot u''(x) = f(x)
\]
is discretized using finite differences:
\[
- \text{coef} \cdot \frac{u_{i-1} - 2u_i + u_{i+1}}{h^2} = f(x_i)
\]

Rearranging:
\[
u_{i-1} - 2u_i + u_{i+1} = - \frac{h^2}{\text{coef}} \cdot f(x_i)
\]

This gives a system of linear equations for \( u_i \), which is solved using matrix methods.

---

## **Output**

The script outputs:
1. **Nodes (`x`)**: The positions along the cable.
2. **Solution (`u_bridge`)**: The deflection of the cable at the nodes.

The plot shows the catenary curve of the cable under the applied forces.

---

## **Applications**

# Finite Difference Approximation of the Second-Order Differential Equation

This document describes the discretization of a second-order differential equation using the **finite difference method**. The differential equation:

\[
- \text{coef} \cdot u''(x) = f(x)
\]

is solved numerically by approximating the derivatives at discrete points using finite differences.

---

## Discretization Process

The finite difference approximation of the second-order derivative is:

\[
u''(x_i) \approx \frac{u_{i-1} - 2u_i + u_{i+1}}{h^2},
\]

where:
- \( h \): The distance between adjacent grid points.
- \( u_i \): The value of \( u(x) \) at the grid point \( x_i \).

By substituting this approximation into the differential equation:

\[
- \text{coef} \cdot \frac{u_{i-1} - 2u_i + u_{i+1}}{h^2} = f(x_i).
\]

---

## Rearranging the Equation

Rewriting the equation for \( u_i \):

\[
u_{i-1} - 2u_i + u_{i+1} = - \frac{h^2}{\text{coef}} \cdot f(x_i).
\]

This forms a system of linear equations for the values of \( u_i \) at each grid point.

---

## Implementation in Code

The equation is implemented using a **tridiagonal matrix** representation, which corresponds to the finite difference approximation for all interior points. Boundary conditions are applied separately.

### Steps:
1. Define the grid points:
   ```matlab
   x = (a:h:b)'; % Generate nodes from a to b with step size h
   ```

2. Construct the tridiagonal matrix for the finite difference approximation:
   ```matlab
   A = gallery('tridiag', n-1, 1, -2, 1); % Tridiagonal matrix
   ```

3. Create the right-hand side vector:
   ```matlab
   F = h^2 .* f(x(2:n)) / coef; % Scale f(x) with h^2 / coef
   ```

4. Apply boundary conditions:
   ```matlab
   F(1) = F(1) + alpha; % Adjust for left boundary condition
   F(n-1) = F(n-1) + beta; % Adjust for right boundary condition
   ```

5. Solve for \( u \) at the interior points:
   ```matlab
   u = zeros(n+1, 1); % Initialize solution vector
   u(2:n) = A \ F;    % Solve for interior nodes
   ```

6. Incorporate boundary values into the solution:
   ```matlab
   u(1) = alpha;     % Left boundary
   u(n+1) = beta;    % Right boundary
   ```

---

## Key Points

- The tridiagonal system of equations represents the finite difference approximation of the second derivative.
- The solution \( u \) provides the approximate values of the dependent variable at each grid point.
- Boundary conditions ensure the solution satisfies physical constraints at the edges of the domain.

---

## Example Application

The method can be used to solve problems such as modeling the deflection of a cable or beam under a load, heat conduction, or other problems involving elliptic partial differential equations.

```matlab
% Example: Solving u''(x) = sin(x) with boundary conditions u(0) = 0, u(pi) = 0
a = 0; b = pi; n = 10; coef = 1;
f = @(x) sin(x);
[x, u] = fdode_bridge(a, b, n, f, 0, 0, coef);
plot(x, u, '-o');
