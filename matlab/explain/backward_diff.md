To deeply understand the given MATLAB function `backward_diff`, we will break it down into every detail, analyzing the code's purpose, structure, and why each part exists. 

---

### **Function Purpose**
The function `backward_diff` computes the numerical gradient (derivative) of a given function \( F \) at a specific point \( x \) using the **backward difference method**. This method approximates the derivative by considering the difference between the function value at \( x \) and \( x-h \), divided by the step size \( h \).

#### **Why Use Backward Difference?**
In numerical differentiation, the derivative of a function \( F \) at \( x \) is defined as:
\[
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{F(x) - F(x-h)}{h}
\]
- The **backward difference method** approximates this by taking a finite (non-zero) step \( h \) backward from \( x \).
- It is particularly useful when \( F(x) \) is not differentiable symbolically or cannot be expressed analytically, such as data-driven functions or black-box models.

### **Code Walkthrough**

#### **Function Declaration**
```matlab
function gradient = backward_diff( F, x, h )
```
1. **Keyword `function`:** Declares that this script defines a MATLAB function.
2. **`gradient`:** The output of the function, which will store the computed numerical gradient.
3. **Inputs:**
   - `F`: The function whose derivative is being calculated. Passed as a **function handle** (e.g., `@cos`).
   - `x`: The point where the derivative is approximated.
   - `h`: The step size used in the calculation. Smaller values of \( h \) increase accuracy but may introduce numerical errors (round-off errors).

#### **Core Computation**
```matlab
gradient = (F(x)-F(x-h))./h;
```

This is the heart of the function. Let’s dissect it step by step:

1. **`F(x)`**:
   - Calls the input function handle `F` and evaluates it at the point \( x \).
   - Example: If \( F = \cos \), then `F(x)` computes \( \cos(x) \).

2. **`F(x-h)`**:
   - Evaluates the function at a point **backward** by \( h \), i.e., \( x - h \).
   - This reflects the **backward difference** method.

3. **`F(x) - F(x-h)`**:
   - Computes the difference in the function’s value between \( x \) and \( x-h \).

4. **Division by `h`**:
   - Dividing the difference by \( h \) normalizes the difference into a rate of change, approximating the derivative.
   - The smaller \( h \), the closer this approximation is to the exact derivative.

5. **Output `gradient`**:
   - Stores the result of the backward difference computation. This is the approximate gradient at \( x \).

#### **Why Use Element-wise Division (`./`)**:
- `./` ensures that the operation is performed element-wise, which is important if \( x \) or \( F(x) \) are vectors or matrices.
- For scalar inputs, this behaves like regular division.

### **Backward Difference Method in Depth**

#### **Definition**
The backward difference method approximates the derivative of \( F \) as:
\[
f'(x) \approx \frac{F(x) - F(x-h)}{h}
\]
This uses points \( x \) and \( x-h \) to calculate the slope of the secant line approximating the tangent at \( x \).

#### **Advantages**
1. **Ease of Computation**:
   - Only requires function values at two points: \( x \) and \( x-h \).
   - No need for additional data or symbolic differentiation.

2. **Simple Implementation**:
   - Requires only subtraction and division.

3. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Useful for edge cases where forward values (\( F(x+h) \)) are unavailable (e.g., in time-series data where past values are known but future values are not).

#### **Limitations**
1. **Truncation Error**:
   - The error from the approximation can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Error} = \frac{h}{2} F''(c), \quad \text{for some } c \in [x-h, x]
     \]
   - As \( h \to 0 \), the approximation becomes more accurate, but too small \( h \) introduces **round-off errors** due to finite-precision arithmetic.

2. **Asymmetric Sampling**:
   - Unlike the **central difference method**, backward difference does not use information symmetrically around \( x \), potentially reducing accuracy.

---

### **Usage Example**
#### Code
```matlab
gradient = backward_diff(@cos, pi/6, 0.5);
disp(gradient);
```

#### Explanation:
1. `@cos`:
   - Passes the cosine function as the input function handle `F`.
2. `pi/6`:
   - Evaluates the derivative at \( x = \frac{\pi}{6} \).
3. `0.5`:
   - Specifies the step size \( h = 0.5 \).

#### Expected Output:
The approximate gradient using backward difference is:
\[
\text{Gradient} \approx \frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) - \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6} - 0.5\right)}{0.5}
\]

---

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **What It Does**: Computes the gradient numerically using the backward difference method.
2. **When to Use It**: Suitable for numerical differentiation when symbolic derivatives are unavailable.
3. **Accuracy Consideration**: Balance \( h \) to reduce both truncation and round-off errors.
4. **Efficiency**: Simple and computationally inexpensive.

By following these details, anyone, regardless of prior knowledge, should be able to understand and implement `backward_diff` confidently.
