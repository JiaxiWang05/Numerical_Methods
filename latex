\section*{AHEP Learning Outcomes Assessed}
This assignment assesses the following AHEP Learning Outcomes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{M1:} Apply knowledge of mathematics, statistics, natural science, and engineering principles to complex problems.
    \item \textbf{M2:} Formulate and analyze complex problems to reach substantiated conclusions.
    \item \textbf{M3:} Select and apply computational and analytical techniques to model complex problems, considering their limitations.
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\section*{Reflective Introduction}
Provide a one-page reflective introduction demonstrating how you have met the learning outcomes. Include a critical review of how your work relates to engineering, and signpost the assignment sections that showcase this knowledge.

\newpage

\section*{Problem 1: Regression (Concrete)}
\subsection*{Data Preparation and Transformation}
Discuss the process of loading the concrete data and transforming it, using water-cement and water-binder ratios, to linearize the relationship between age and compressive strength.

\subsection*{First Regression Analysis}
Explain and present results from the first regression, showing plots of $b_0$ and $b_1$ versus $\log(\text{Age})$. Provide commentary on the linearity of these relationships.

\subsection*{Second Regression Analysis}
Discuss the second regression that models $b_0$ and $b_1$ as functions of age. Show scatter plots for Age 14, and compare models using estimated versus calculated parameters.

\subsection*{Model Performance}
Assess the residuals for transformed and raw data on training and testing sets. Present R-squared values in a table and discuss any patterns in performance and recommendations for improvement.

\newpage

\section*{Problem 2: Statistics (Wind Turbine SCADA Analysis)}
\subsection*{Data Summary and Initial Scatter Plots}
Provide a brief summary of the SCADA data. Include scatter plots of wind speed versus energy production for both datasets, and hypothesize potential differences between them.

\subsection*{Binning Analysis}
Using wind speed bins, compute and plot the mean, standard deviation, and 95\% confidence intervals for each bin. Plot and discuss results, including any insights on turbine performance.

\newpage

\section*{Problem 3: [Insert Problem Title]}
\subsection*{Data Analysis and Calculations}
Describe the approach to solve Problem 3, including any data preparation steps, and computations necessary for your analysis.

\subsection*{Results and Discussion}
Present the results in a clear format, using tables or graphs where helpful. Discuss implications of findings in relation to the problem objectives.

\newpage

\section*{Conclusion}
Summarize the key insights and learning outcomes achieved through this coursework. Discuss how the analytical methods applied reinforce engineering principles and potential real-world implications.

\newpage

\section*{References}
Provide full references in IEEE or Harvard style, ensuring all sources used for data, theory, and background are properly cited.

\section*{Acknowledgments}
Detail any use of generative AI tools, including specific sections of the report or code where these tools were used.
